    <h2>One-Pan White Cheddar Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p> <em> If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! </em> </p>
    <p>The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:initial">
        <li> 16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li> 2 &#189;cups milk</li> 
        <li> 2 cups water</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic salt </li> 
        <li> &#189; teaspoon salt/li>
        <li> &#188; cup margarine</li>
        <li> &#188; teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1 &#189; cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li> &#188; cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li> &#188; cup real bacon bits</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>PCombine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
        <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>     
        <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
