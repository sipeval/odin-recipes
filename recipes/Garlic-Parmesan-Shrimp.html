    <h2>Delicious Garlic Parmesan Shrimp</h2>
    <p> <strong> Crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture.</strong> </p>
    <p>I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! 
        <em>Serve with pasta and salad.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:georgian">
        <li> nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li> 1 cup dry bread crumbs</li> <!-- space after li is useless-->
        <li> 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li> 1  teaspoons garlic powder</li> <!-- &#189; symbol for half -->
        <li> 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons butter, melted, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag.
             Seal and shake to mix ingredients together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread crumb mixture remaining in the bag.
            Drizzle melted butter over the top. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            Switch to broil setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
