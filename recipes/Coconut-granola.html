    <h2>Delicious coconut granola</h2>
    <p> <em> Coconut is one of my favorite flavors, and I love its nutty flavor when toasted. </em> </p>
    <p>This recipe comes together in a few minutes and will last for several weeks in a closed container, making it a great make-ahead breakfast option. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:initial">
        <li> 5 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li> 2 cups almonds </li> 
        <li> 2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic salt </li> 
        <li> 1 &#188;cups maple syrup</li>
        <li> &#189; cup coconut oil </li>
        <li> 1 egg white</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cardamom</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><p>Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. </p><p>Use your hands or a wooden spoon to thoroughly mix, until oats and nuts are well coated. Spread mixture onto prepared baking sheets in an even layer.</p></li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Stir granola and rotate pans 20 minutes into baking time so that it browns evenly.</li>
        <li>Cool completely, then transfer to lidded containers or jars. Store at room temperature for up to two weeks.<p> Serve with milk, yogurt, or your choice of fruit (I like berries, peaches, mango or pineapple).</p></li>
